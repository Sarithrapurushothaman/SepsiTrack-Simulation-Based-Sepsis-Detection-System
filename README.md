Overview:
SepsiTrack is a simulation-based project focused on early detection and monitoring of sepsis using signal processing techniques. This system analyzes physiological parameters such as heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and respiratory rate to identify potential sepsis indicators.

Key Features:
Simulation-based evaluation for sepsis detection
Real-time monitoring and analysis
Integration with LabVIEW for data processing and visualization

Technologies Used:
Simulation Tools: LabVIEW
Data Processing: Signal Processing Techniques for Sepsis Detection

Usage:
Load sample data into the simulation environment.
Run the LabVIEW scripts to analyze trends and detect potential sepsis cases.
Visualize results through LabVIEW-generated reports and plots.
